# About this Package

Split Raster is a python package to split a large image into small tiles. It is useful for deep learning and computer vision tasks. The package can also be used to split a large image into small tiles for other applications.

The initial version of the package is developed by Chris to provide good support for deep learning and computer vision tasks on Satelite Images by creating tiled output image samples from an input raster dataset.
