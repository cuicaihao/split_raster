# Split Raster

Provide good support for deep learning and computer vision tasks by creating a tiled output from an input raster dataset.'

## Use the packages

```bash
pip install splitpackage
```

## Try Sample code

```python

from splitraster import io

input_image_path = "../data/raw/RGB.png"
gt_image_path = "../data/raw/GT.png"

save_path = "../data/processed/RGB"
crop_size = 256
repetition_rate = 0.5
overwrite = False

n = io.split_image(input_image_path, save_path, crop_size,
                   repetition_rate=repetition_rate, overwrite=overwrite)
print(f"{n} tiles sample of {input_image_path} are added at {save_path}")

save_path_gt = "../data/processed/GT"
n = io.split_image(gt_image_path, save_path_gt, crop_size,
                   repetition_rate=repetition_rate, overwrite=overwrite)
print(f"{n} tiles sample of {gt_image_path} are added at {save_path_gt}")


```
